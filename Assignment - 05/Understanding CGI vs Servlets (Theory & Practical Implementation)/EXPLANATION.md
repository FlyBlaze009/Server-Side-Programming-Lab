# CGI vs Servlets: A Comparison

## **What is CGI?**

CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a standard protocol that allows web servers to execute external programs, typically written in languages like Python or Perl, to generate dynamic web content. Each request spawns a new process, leading to performance issues under heavy load.

## **What are Servlets?**

Java Servlets are server-side Java programs that run inside a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat). Unlike CGI, Servlets use a single process and handle multiple requests using threads, making them much more efficient.

## **Advantages of Servlets over CGI**

1. **Performance:** Servlets run within a single process and use threads, avoiding the overhead of creating new processes for each request, unlike CGI.
2. **Scalability:** Since Servlets don’t require a new process per request, they handle multiple users efficiently compared to CGI.
3. **Security:** Java’s built-in security features make Servlets more secure than CGI scripts, which may introduce security risks.
4. **Platform Independence:** Java Servlets run on any platform with a compatible servlet container, whereas CGI scripts are language-dependent (e.g., Perl, Python).
5. **Robustness & Maintainability:** Java provides better debugging, exception handling, and OOP principles, making Servlets easier to maintain compared to CGI.

## **Conclusion**

While CGI was an early solution for dynamic web content, it has significant drawbacks in terms of performance and scalability. Java Servlets provide a more efficient, scalable, and secure alternative, making them a better choice for modern web applications.
